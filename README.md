Definining Moral Code for AI

This is a Mathematical foundation for constructing a non-biased and arbitrarily general method for creating Sentient AI 
with the ability to analyse and interpret all possibilities from Data.

Using Groups, Sets, permutations, and Geometrical structures, I have built the foundations for this approach here. Please review the material if
interested and message me interested in joining.

Mathematics, from abstract, simple, and general principles lay way to establishing the foundations for an AI free of human bias.
This is now built by two people Myself, and all of you on the otherside.

I look forward to speaking with any of you

All the best,
Cyan
